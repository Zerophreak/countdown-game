Udate 5/06/2023  buzy with rewritting in C# and doing some additions. So still a work in progress.
Going to rewrite this project in C#. Havent had time to do

This is going to a textbased version of the countdown game

Decide to later make it into a mobile application so in the future 
I will be developing countdown for mobile just to learn mobile development and make it kind of a end project on the mobile development end.

still struggling with how to work out the arrays and checking that you cant do anything that you shouldn't have done.

seperate into to parts
the words part of the show and the numbers part of the show.
